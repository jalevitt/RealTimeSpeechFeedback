# RealTimeSpeechFeedback
A project being developed on behalf of the Stepp Lab at Boston University to give feedback in real time to speakers regarding pitch, vocal tract length, and formants

DEPENDECIES:
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
scikits.talkbox
pyaudio
Tkinter
PyQt4
matplotlibwidget

If you already have a default installation python XY, all these packages should already been installed except for one:
specififically scikits.talkbox. The installation of this is simple. Just open Command Prompt and type:

pip install scikits.talkbox

If you wish to run the App, first clone the master branch of this project, then open the file UserMain.py in your favorite 
python IDE, then press RUN. The app should open quickly. Alternatively you can run this same file from the command line like 
any other python script by navigating to the folder in which you have downloaded the project, and entering:

python UserMain.py

The app should open promptly.

I'm in process of turning this into a .exe file so that you won't need to mess about with a python IDE, but that's still in progress.
